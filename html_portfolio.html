                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <strong><small>I am a very simple person and don’t need too much to keep me happy! I have a wonderful family; being my mother & father, my sister & brother, and lastly my dog. I wouldn’t be the person I am today without the help and teachings I had learned from my parents. I also have a great group of friends; some I met in k-12 and some who I have just recently met in college and from work. </small></strong>

                <h1>Background Information</h1>
                <strong><small>My name is Hayden. I am from Fishers Indiana and currently live in downtown Indianapolis. Growing up, I went through Hamilton Southeastern & Fishers school system. I then moved on the Ball State University where I spent four years working on my bachelor’s degree in marketing and Digital Media. While also going through school, I decided to work with a company by the name of MacAllister Machinery where I worked for the entirety of my school terms. Once I had graduated from Ball State, I was offered a job from the same company as an Inside Sales Representative for renting out construction equipment. I found that the industry was a very toxic and older populated company. I didn’t seem to fit in with the crowd and eventually I had enough. That is what brought me here today, to improve what was already taught to me about software engineering by my minor in school. I look forward to jump starting my digital career as a professional in the software engineering field!</small></strong>

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <strong><small>I grew up being a three-sport athlete, playing football, basketball, and jumped in track. So, I typically spend a lot of my time working on myself at the gym. I also enjoy my video games, mainly Nintendo named games on the Switch & Wii. I have a collection of all the different Nintendo consoles. Some of my favorite titles revolved around Pokémon, Mario Kart, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, Don’t Starve, the list goes on. I also love collecting Pokémon cards, I have been collecting since I was in grade school and have a large collection to this day. I love watching NFL & NHL, my favorite teams being the Indianapolis Colts and the Chicago Blackhawks. Other forms of entertainment, I love listening to music, watching anime and live shows, and well produced movies. Socially, most of what I do is spent with my family and friends. They are the people I can truly open to and can let loose and not fake my personality. And lastly, I volunteer quite often. Some of my notible actions include volunteering at <a href="https://twitter.com/bsudm?lang=en">Riley Dance Marathon</a> & being an operator at <a href="https://est.event.stjude.org/ELP/KSTRUCTION/">Kidstruction events</a>.</small></strong>

                <h1>Why Software Development?</h1>
                <strong><small>With Digital Media being my minor going through university, it completely revolved around web design and storytelling. But the course had coding course I took, and I absolutely loved the concept. Sadly, I never gave the industry a chance in the job hunt after school. I just hopped in the first role where I thought I would make the most money and that was the easiest to make happen in such short time. But I later found that the industry and work didn’t make me happy. And that is what brought me back to the industry. I owe it to myself to give this a try and thus far, going through these assignments, I am getting a sensation that I didn’t feel when going the sales and marketing route. I am looking forward to a great bootcamp and chance to learn this concept more in-depth! </small></strong>
